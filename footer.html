				<p>My favorite charity is the Stray Animal Adoption Program, or <a href="https://adoptastray.com/">SAAP</a>. The charity rescues dogs and cats, and keeps them in foster families until they are adopted. They are a non-profit organization, so the rely solely on donations. All donations are tax-deductible and go towards the rescue and care for the animals. All annimals adopted from SAAP are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on shots.</p>

						<b>About:</b> We adopted our cat Jasper in November 2018. He is a very playful cat, who loves to chase after twist ties, and play under the bed. When we adopted him, he was the last of his litter and almost six months old. Jasper knows everybody's alarm, and never fails to get us up on time if we forget to set them with lots of meowing and kneading. He'll never admit it, but he loves to play with our dogs Raven and Jade. His favorite game is to hide under the bed and attack any unsuspecting dog that walks by. He also enjoys watching the birds at at our feeders and making his own bird calls.

						<b>About:</b> In March of 2019, we adopted our dog Raven. Before we adopted her, she was found with her 2 sisters and three brothers abandoned in a dumpster. She was rescued by SAAP and given all the care and medication she needed, so she was perfectly healthy when we adopted her! Raven LOVES to chase after her tennis ball, and play with her sister Jade. Raven is very friendly with dogs, but spends most of her time at the dog park chasing after her ball. She was the runt of the litter, but now she is bigger than all of her siblings! She also has extremely picky taste for a dog that was found in a dumpster. She only eats one brand of food, and it needs to be a different flavor at least every other week.

						<b>About:</b> We adopted Jade in February of 2020. She was part of a litter that was 6 boys and 2 girls. We adopted her when she was 4 months old. Jade is extremely friendly and loves to meet new people, dogs, cats, birds, or anything else. Jade's favorite activity is to play in the water. In the summer, Jade spends her time swimming in our pool or playing in the sprinkler. Jade also likes to go to the dog park and play with all the dogs there and greet any new dog coming through the gates. Jade knows when it is time to eat and always gives me a thirty minute warning, 15 minute warning, and if necessary drops her bowl at my feet when it is five o'clock. She is extremely food motivated, as long as she knows there are treats in my pocket, she is on her best behavior.
