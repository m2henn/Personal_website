						<h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Bio</h1>
						<p>I am a graduate from Larry A. Ryle High School in Union, Kentucky. I am currently attending Northern Kentucky University pursuing Bachelor's Degrees in statistics and computer science. After graduation, my goal is to become an actuary and work in the insurance industry.</p>
						<br />
						<p>In the summer of 2020, I participated in the UR-STEM Research program at NKU. During this project, I worked with Dr. Agard and Dr. Nolan to attempt to predict the best possible time for an olympic swimming event, as well as as the year we could expect to see this record. Throughout this experience, I learned to use a variety of statistical software including excel and minitab. I also learned many real world applications of common models and regression analysis.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Currently, I am taking the course financial mathematics to prepare for actuarial exam FM. I am expecting to take the exam in June of 2021. Upon passing, I hope to get an internship with one of the many insurance companies in the Cincinnati area. My top pick is to work at Great American, because I will be able to meet actuaries from both the SOA anc CAS, which will help me to decide which industry I want to work in when I graduate.</p>
						<br />
						<p>This summer, I will be working with Dr Holden and Dr DK on a project where I will apply math to solve a real world problem in finance. They have invited an alum who works as an actuary for Great American Insurance to work with us. I am very excited to work on this project, as I think it will help build my resume, as well as give me anidea of what it is like to work as an actuary.</p>
