			<h2>Fitness</h2>
			<p>I have always been a very active person. As I kid, I rode my bike every where I could. Eventually, I developed an interest in bodybuilding, and my dad showed me some exercises I could do with the bench and squat rack we had in our basement. This introduction led to an obsession that I still have today. I stopped playing all sports so I could spend more time lifting weights and riding my bike. Even today, I spend at least an hour every day either riding my bike or lifting weights. In May of 2020, I was going to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest, but it was canceled due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Someday, I hope to compete at least once.</p>

			<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<p>Another hobby that I really enjoy is playing video games. If I had to pick a genre that is my favorite, I would choose either survival or strategy. I primarily play games on my PC, but I play a few things on xbox. My favorite franchise is Sid Meier's Civilization. I started playing Civilization V when it came out in 2010, and have played every game in the series since then. My favorite studio is Firaxis, which is the developer for two of my favorite franchises, civilization and XCOM. I can not wait until Elder Scrolls VI and Dying Light 2 are released. I really enjoyed playing the games befor them, and both of these look like they will be incredible games! </p>
